**COMPUTER VISION ROLE**<br>


**TASK:-**
Mask R-CNN is an object detection model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) developed by Facebook AI researchers in 2017. The model could return both the bounding box and a mask for the detected object in an image.


### About Mask R-CNN
The Mask R-CNN model addresses one of the most difficult computer vision challenges: image segmentation. Image segmentation is the task of detecting and distinguishing multiple objects within a single image. In particular, Mask R-CNN performs "instance segmentation," which means that different instances of the same type of object in the input image, for example, car, should be assigned distinct labels.
